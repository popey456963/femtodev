      <description>I admit it, yesterday, I built yet another URL shortener with some friends of mine from Subject Refresh. Despite most URL shorteners being detrimental to society, with them disappearing and taking massive sections of the internet with them, we thought we&amp;rsquo;d add yet another one to see how well our team worked together.
We managed to buy the domain, setup the server and host our website in under an hour. This shocked us as we had never done anything in such a short timeframe before.</description>
