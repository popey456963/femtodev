Minimal design is the name given to a monorepo of websites that all share the same authentication and web serving systems.  It was originally the host of systems like https://femto.pw and others, which have now been moved to "Femto Apps".  "Femto Apps"' architecture shall be discussed at a later point, for now this is a discussion of the monolith that was "Minimal Design".
